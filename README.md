### AIM: Are your processes running? Then you should go out and catch them!

### NOTES: 
> First, we learned about **processes**. Every running program is a process. A process can create a subprocess, but they function exactly the same as regular processes do.

> A processor can handle 1 process per cycle (per core). "Multitasking" appears to happen because the processor switches between all the active processes quickly. 

> You can type `ps` in the command line to see all of the processes that your computer is currently running.

`pid`
* Every process has a unique identifier called the PID (Process IDentifier)
* `pid` 1 is the init process
* Each entry in the /proc entry is a current `pid`

`getpid()` - `<unistd.h>` — returns the current process's `pid`

`getppid()` - `<unistd.h>` — return the current process's parent's `pid`

> Then, we learned about **signals**. A signal is a limited way of sending information to a process.

`kill`
* Command line utility to send a signal to process
`$ kill \<PID\>`
Sends signal 15 (SIGTERM) to PID
`$ kill -\<SIGNAL\> \<PID\>`
Sends SIGNAL to PID

`killall`
`$ killall [-\<SIGNAL\>] \<PROCESS\>`

* Sends SIGTERM (or SIGNAL if provided) to all processes with PROCESS as the name

> To handle signals in C programs, we use `<signal.h>`

`kill \<PID\>, \<SIGNAL\>` — returns 0 on success or -1 (errno) on failure

EXAMPLE C CODE:
```
static void sighandler (int signo) {
    if (signo == SIGINT)
        printf("Nice try!\n");
}

int main () {
    signal(SIGINT, sighandler);
    while(1) {
         printf("pid: %d\n", getpid());
    }
return 0;
}
```
